    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up, I was always captivated by space—the stars, the planets, the sheer
         mystery of it all. But as I got older, I realized most people don't truly grasp 
         just how vast and incredible the universe really is. It made me sad to see how easily we 
         overlook the scale of everything beyond Earth. That's why I'm starting this journey—to 
         educate, to spark curiosity, and to help others feel the same awe I've felt since I was a kid ~Adyl
